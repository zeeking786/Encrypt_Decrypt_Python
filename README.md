Here I have Created a mini encryption and decryption project which takes the name , message , key , selection of encrypt and decrypt and output .

Steps For Encryption :

1. You have to enter your name .
2. Write your message what you want to encrypt .
3. Give the key in number format .
4. Select encrypt by giving "e" for encrypt .
and then output will be encrypt .
